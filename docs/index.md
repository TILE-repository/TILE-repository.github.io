## Background

Test Informed Learning with Examples (TILE), is a new approach to introduce software testing in introductory programming courses in the following ways:

early 
:	introduce students to testing from the very first example program they see and write themselves in exercises;

seamless 
:	testing will be introduced in a smooth and continuous way as an inherent part of programming, and not as a separate activity;

subtle
:	we will make use of clever and indirect methods to teach them testing knowledge and skills.

Test Informed Learning with Examples (TILE) was inspired by Test-driven learning (TDL). 
TDL was coined in 2006 by Janzen and Saiedian^[[Test-driven learning: intrinsic integration of testing into the CS/SE curriculum]{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1121419}]. 
It describes a pedagogical approach to teaching computer programming that involves introducing and exploring new programming concepts using examples and exercises that evolve around testing. 
It offers the potential of teaching testing ``for free'' as early as possible without adding any additional strain on the course schedule. 
When teaching programming many examples are being given, programming is often learned through examples. 
Examples related to testing take the same effort to present than other examples.
Janzen et. al. ^[[Test-driven learning in early programming courses]{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1352322.1352315} [Implications of integrating test-driven development into CS1/CS2 curricula]{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1508865.1508921}] continued their work more in the direction of Test Driven Development (TDD) such they diverted\footnote{This was confirmed by one of the authors of the TDM approach, David Janzen in a personal communication.} from their initial TDL ideas. 
As a consequence, at this moment, there does not exist a clearly defined approach that can be used by any teacher to effortless introduce TDL in their programming course. 
To fill this gap, we developed TILE, Test Informed Learning with Examples.
Exercises making use of TILE are named TILES.

## Types of TILES

We defined three types of tiles

test run TILES
:	tiles in students are encouraged to write tests

test cases TILES
:	dafdsf

test domain TILES
:	dafsdf

## Example one

## Example two

## Example three
