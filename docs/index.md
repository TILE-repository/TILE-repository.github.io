Prepare a draft of the web page for your assignment, including the table of metadata described below. The purpose of the web page is to introduce the assignment to another educator.

## About me

| Summary | Random Sentence Generator – build a sort of grammar structure in memory – lots of uses of pointers, collections, and hashing. Then use a simple recursion over that structure to generate random output. |
|---|---|
| Topics | A neat application of recursion and pointer-intensive data structures. |
| Audience | Appropriate for CS2 or a later course. |
| Difficulty | This is an intermediate to advanced assignment, taking 1 or 2 weeks for a CS2 student. |
| Strengths | The great strength of this assignment is that the grammars and their output can be quite funny. Also, the data structure and the recursion are moderately complex but neat. Students like this assignment. |
| Weaknesses | Some parsing is required to build the grammar, which is not that fun. Also, this is not a concise, focused pointer/recursion problem. It has more heft to it. |
| Dependencies | Requires an understanding of pointers, recursion, and enough sophistication to deal with a data structure with 2 or 3 layers to it. Works fine in many languages. Hashing may or may not be used. The data structure has a natural map/collection structure, so using library classes can make it easier. |
| Variants | Because there are quite a few collections in the RSG, we have used it as a nice driver for students to implement their own collection that is instantiated in several places to build the RSG. |
