## How to use this template

First of all, thank you for reading this. This means you are creating a TILED assignment for the repository. Great! We welcome additions so we can all benefit from each others knowledge and improve software testing education one step at the time! 

Please fill in this template with all the information about you and your assignment. You can describe the assignment, add for example handouts, source code, images, instructions for the lecturer et cetera. This will be transformed into a webpage with your assignment and put on the repository website.

These are the steps you need to take to do this:

1. Replace everything in here with content related to the assignment, starting with the `YAML` header on the top of the page. You can use markdown in the body to structure and describe the assignment. It is possible to include images, code listings and links to files or other pages. If you are not familiar with markdown, please look at the [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on how to use markdown.
2. Describe the assignment as clearly as possible, provide examples and one or more solutions to be used as reference.
3. Please fill in the `metadata` so that it is clear what the assignment is about and where it might fit in existing computer science programs.
4. Put all related files in the folder together with this file. Make sure you link to the files from this markdown file.

If you need any help, don't hesitate to contact the repository maintainers.

## Topics

The assignments will be accessable based on the topics. We use the following taxonomy:

- Variables, expressions, types
- Assignment statements
- Strings
  - Indexation
  - Slicing
  - Build-in functions and methods
- Console input/output
- Conditionals (if-elif-else)
- Exceptions
- Errors
- Loops/iterations (while/for)
- Functions
- Unit tests
- Modules/libraries
- Structured types
  - Tuples
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
- File input/output
- GUI
- Object oriented programming
- Advanced topics
  - Recursion
  - Functional programming (lambda expressions)
- Algorithms
  - Hashing

If you use one or more of these topics in your metadata, we will index the assignment under those topics.
