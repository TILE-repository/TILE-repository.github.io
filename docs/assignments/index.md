## How to contribute

We welcome additions to this repository so we can all benefit from each others knowledge and material and improve software testing education one step at the time. Contributing can be done using the Fork and pull model. Anyone can fork this repository and push changes to their personal fork. You do not need permission to this repository to push to a user-owned fork. The changes can be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer.

## Forking this repository

Forking a repository is similar to copying a repository, with two major differences:

    You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your user-owned fork to the original repository, also known as the upstream repository.
    You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository.



More information in working with forks can be found in the Github Docs on [working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
