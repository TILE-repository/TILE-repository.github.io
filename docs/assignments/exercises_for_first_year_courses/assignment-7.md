# Working with expressions





Let us practice a bit with writing expressions. Implement a program that asks the user for two numbers, $$x$$ and $$y$$ and calculates the following:

1.  $$x+y$$

2.  $$(x+y)x$$

3.  $$xx + yy$$

4.  $$x^{5y}$$

5.  $$3x^5-5x^3+2x-7$$

6.  $$yx^5-(y+1)x^3+5x-y$$

7.  $$x^{yy+2^y}$$

Test your program (and your math skills) by:

-   First doing he exercises by hand for $$x=4$$ and $$y=6$$ to obtain
    the expected outputs.

-   Second, check the answers of your program with your expected
    outputs.

```testruntile
We ask the students to do the calculations by hand such that they
can use those to test their program. It makes them aware of the need
for an oracle with which they need to check the outputs.
