# Simple calculator





The expressions on the right of the assignment can be all complex that we want. 
Implement a program that reads two real numbers, calculates and prints their sum (`+`), subtraction (`-`), product (`*`) and division (`/`).

```
>>> %Run 
    Enter a real number: 2.5
    Enter another real number: 34.903
    The sum is: 37.403
    The subtraction is: -32.403
    The product is: 87.2575
    The division is: 0.07162708076669627
>>> %Run 
    Enter a real number: 0
    Enter another real number: 4
    The sum is: 4.0
    The subtraction is: -4.0
    The product is: 0.0
    The division is: 0.0
>>> %Run 
    Enter a real number: 2000
    Enter another real number: 45.88
    The sum is: 2045.88
    The subtraction is: 1954.12
    The product is: 91760.0
    The division is: 43.59197907585004
```

What happens when you test your programs with two zeros? Why does
that happen? What could we do about that?

TILEd by adding example test executions for them to test.
