# Letter exchanger






Write a Python program that asks the user for a word $$p$$ and it
returns in the output another word in which the first and last
characters of $$p$$ have been exchanged. Use the chain cutter
operator. Run the following tests to test the operation of your
program:

**test case ID** | **input** | **expected output** 
------------------|-----------|---------------------
1                | `""`      | `""`                
2                | `"a"`     | `"a"`               
3                | `"ab"`    | `"ba"`              
4                | `"ab ba"` | `"ab ba"`           


```testruntile
Insist that the students test their programs by giving them a table
of test cases.
