# Variables as operator and operand





Copy and test the following program:

```python
a = int(input("Enter a value for a = "))
a = a + 1
print("The value of the variable a is now ", a);
```

As can be seen, the same variable can appear both as an operand and
as an operator. This is a normal and widely used programming
situation, so you should get used to it. Now replace the instruction
*a = a + 1* by *a += 1*.

```testruntile
This exercise would say: "copy and execute the following program",
the change to "copy and test the following program" is a very
subtle TILE.
