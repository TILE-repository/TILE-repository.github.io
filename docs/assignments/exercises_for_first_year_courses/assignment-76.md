# Reading and filtering names and birth dates from a file

From the [Saving names and birth dates to a file](exercises_for_first_year_courses/assignment-75.md) exercise, make a program that reads the file `"dates.txt"` and tells us how many people were born in May. In the example above, there is only one person who was born in May. To test your program well, make sure that you also test it with different
files `"dates.txt"`:

-   a file `"dates.txt"` which has no one born in May
-   a file `"dates.txt"` which has more than one person born in May
