# Multiples of 7 not divisible by 3





Modify the previous program so that it displays only those multiples
of 7 between 1 and $$N$$ that are not divisible by 3. Execute the
following test cases to test your program:

**test case ID**   |**inputs**   |**expected outputs**                
-------------- |-------- ------------------------------- --
1              |0       | there are no multiples of 7     
2              |3        |there are no multiples of 7     
3             | -5     |  there are no multiples of 7     
4             | -65     | -7, -14, -28, -35, -49, -56     
5             | 18     |  7, 14                           
6             | 77      | 7, 14, 28, 35, 49, 56, 70, 77

Insist that the students test their programs by giving them example
test cases in a table.
