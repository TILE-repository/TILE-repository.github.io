# Removing first and last digits from and interger

Write a function that, given an integer $$N1$$, returns another integer $$N2$$ that is the result of removing the first and last digit of $$N1$$. Note: If $$N1$$ has 2 digits or only one, then $$N2$$ must be 0. Examples of test cases that you can automate with pytest are:

**testcase number**   |**input ($$N1$$)**   |**expected output ($$N2$$)**
-----------------|-------------- |------------------------
1              |   42635    |      263
2             |    23       |      0
3              |   5        |      0
4             |    0         |     0
5             |    -3456     |     -45
