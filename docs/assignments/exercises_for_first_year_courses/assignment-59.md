# The greatest common divisor of more than 2 numbers

Write a function `gcd_3num` that calculates the greatest common divisor of more than 2 numbers. To do this, use the function `gcd` (greatest common divisor of 2 numbers).

Write pytests to test your implementation.

```testruntile
Insist that the students test their programs by adding a line
telling them to do it.
