# Prime or not

By [Tanja E.J. Vos](https://www.tanjavos.com).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python exercises used for first year programming courses that
have been adapted by using Test Informed Learning with Examples (TILE)
to integrate testing in programming education without it costing (much)
more time. The coloured boxes indicate how they were TILEd.

This colour box explains a TILE in the test domain.

```testruntile
This colour box explains a TILE related to test runs 
and/or test cases.

# Assignment

Write a program to determine whether an integer is prime or not. A
prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has only two
positive divisors: itself and 1. 

For example, the prime numbers less than 200 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43,
47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113,
127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191,
193, 197, 199. You can use them as test cases for your program.

Remember, you should not only tests whether primes are detected
correctly. You should also test other numbers and check your program
says they are not prime. Also try with negative numbers.

```testruntile
Insist that the students test their programs by giving them ideas or
pointers about the test data to use.
