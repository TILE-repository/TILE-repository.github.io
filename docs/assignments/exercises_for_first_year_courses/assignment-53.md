# Test Informed Learning with Examples assignment



------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python exercises used for first year programming courses that
have been adapted by using Test Informed Learning with Examples (TILE)
to integrate testing in programming education without it costing (much)
more time. The coloured boxes indicate how they were TILEd.

```testdomaintile
This colour box explains a TILE in the test domain.
```

```testruntile
This colour box explains a TILE related to test runs 
and/or test cases.
```
