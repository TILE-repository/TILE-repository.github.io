# Currency symbol lookup

Write a program that stores in a variable the following dictionary:

`{'Euro':'€', 'Dollar':'$', 'Yen':'¥'},`

It should ask the user for a currency and display its symbol or a
warning message if the currency is not in the dictionary.

```small
>>> %Run 
    Enter a currency: Euro
    €
>>> %Run 
    Enter a currency: Dollar
    $
>>> %Run 
    Enter a currency: Wow
    That currency is not in the dictionary
```
