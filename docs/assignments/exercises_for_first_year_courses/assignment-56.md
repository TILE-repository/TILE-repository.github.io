# Calculate factorials


Write a function `factorial` that given a positive integer `n` calculates the factorial. Remember that the factorial of `n` is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 (that is, the natural numbers) to `n`. For example:

$$5! = 5\ x\ 4\ x\ 3\ x\ 2\ x\ 1$$

Write pytests to test your implementation. Remember that $$0! = 1$$ and $$1! = 1$$.

Insist that the students test their programs by adding a line
telling them to do it.
