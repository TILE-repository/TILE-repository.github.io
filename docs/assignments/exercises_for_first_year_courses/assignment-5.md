# More advanced calculator

Implement a program that reads two integer numbers, calculates and prints their addition, subtraction, product, division and modulus or remainder (`%`).

```
>>> %Run 
    Enter a integer number: 4
    Enter another integer number: 6
    The sum (4 + 6) is:  10
    The subtraction (4 - 6) is:  -2
    The product (4 * 6) is:  24
    The division (4/6) is:  0.6666666666666666
    The modulus or remainder (4 % 6) is:  4
>>> %Run 
    Enter a integer number: 0
    Enter another integer number: -100
    The sum (0 + -100) is:  -100
    The subtraction (0 - -100) is:  100
    The product (0 * -100) is:  0
    The division (0 / -100) is:  0
    The modulus or remainder (4 % -100) is:  0
