# MadLibs





Mad Libs is a phrase template word game where a player asks others
for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, often
comical or nonsensical, and which will be read aloud later. We are
going to make a little Mad Libs.

Look at the following example:

![image](images/MadLib-testing.jpg)

We need to ask the player for the following words in English:

-   verb, for example: `write`

-   plural noun, for example: `problems`

-   adjective, for example: `fun`

So for these examples, our program returns:

`Whether you write computer programs to solve problems or just for fun, it is very important that you ALWAYS TEST your code for bugs. `

Try other inputs and try to come up with a funny phrase.

```testdomaintile
This TILE contains the message that testing is important.
