# MadLibs

By [Tanja E.J. Vos](https://www.tanjavos.com).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python exercises used for first year programming courses that
have been adapted by using Test Informed Learning with Examples (TILE)
to integrate testing in programming education without it costing (much)
more time. The coloured boxes indicate how they were TILEd.

```testdomaintile
This colour box explains a TILE in the test domain.
```

```testruntile
This colour box explains a TILE related to test runs 
and/or test cases.
```

# Assignment

Mad Libs is a phrase template word game where a player asks others
for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, often
comical or nonsensical, and which will be read aloud later. We are
going to make a little Mad Libs.

Look at the following example:

![image](images/MadLib-testing.jpg)

We need to ask the player for the following words in English:

-   verb, for example: `write`

-   plural noun, for example: `problems`

-   adjective, for example: `fun`

So for these examples, our program returns:

`Whether you write computer programs to solve problems or just for fun, it is very important that you ALWAYS TEST your code for bugs. `

Try other inputs and try to come up with a funny phrase.

```testdomaintile
This TILE contains the message that testing is important.
```
