# Celsius to Fahrentheit converter


Implement a program that calculates the temperature in degrees Celsius from the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. 
The formula is as follows: $$C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)\;.$$ 
The input to the program is degrees Fahrenheit introduced by the user. 
We will save this value in a variable, for example `F`. 
Then, the program calculates the expression given by the formula and stores the result in another variable, for example `C`. The last step will consist of printing the result for the user.

```
>>> %Run
    Enter the degrees Fahrenheit: 84
    84.0 degrees Fahrenheit are 28.9 degrees Celsius
```

Run more tests of your program and use the following online
converter to check the outputs of your program:

We invite the student to test their program more and compare their
outcomes with a parallel oracle that they can find on the web.
