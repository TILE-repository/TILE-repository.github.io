# Maximum and minumum





Implement a program that reads three values and displays on the
screen the maximum and the minimum. Run the following examples to
test that your program gives the same outputs:

```small
>>> %Run 
    Enter the first value: 3
    Enter the second value: 6
    Enter the third value: 8
    The maximum is 8 and the minimum is 3
>>> %Run 
    Enter the first value: -4
    Enter the second value: 6
    Enter the third value: 12
    The maximum is 6 and the minimum is -4
>>> %Run
    Enter the first value: 4.567
    Enter the second value: 9
    Enter the third value: 12.9
    The maximum is 9 and the minimum is 12.9
>>> %Run 
    Enter the first value: a
    Enter the second value: c
    Enter the third value: h
    The maximum is h and the minimum is a
>>> %Run 
    Enter the first value: hello
    Enter the second value: hola
    Enter the third value: bonjour
    The maximum is hola and the minimum is bonjour
>>> %Run 
    Enter the first value: 4
    Enter the second value: oh!
    Enter the third value: 4.89
    The maximum is oh! and the minimum is 4
```

```testruntile
Insist that the students test their programs by giving them example
test executions. The values used in the example test executions will
make then aware that the program was not only for numerical values
but for any value.
