# Multiples of seven





Write a program that receives an integer $$N$$ and generates all the
multiples of 7 between 1 and $$N$$. Run the following test cases to
test your program:

**test case ID**  | **inputs** |  **expected outputs**              
--------------| --------| -------------------------------
1          |    0     |   there are no multiples of 7     
2          |    3     |   there are no multiples of 7     
3           |   -5   |    there are no multiples of 7     
4           |   -15   |   -7, -14                         
5           |   18   |    7, 14                           
6           |   57    |   7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56

Insist that the students test their programs by giving them example
test cases in a table. Again the chosen values will make them aware
that there program should also work for negative numbers.
