# Armstrong numbers





A three-digit number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the
cube of its digits equals the number itself. For example, 153 is an
Armstrong number because ($$1 ^ 3$$) + ($$5 ^ 3$$) + ($$3 ^ 3$$) = 153.
Write all Armstrong numbers between 100 and 500.

To test your program consider these numbers, which are the only
Armstrong numbers:

$$153=1^3+5^3+3^3$$

$$370=3^3+7^3+0^3$$

$$371=3^3+7^3+1^3$$

$$407=4^3+0^3+7^3$$

Insist that the students test their programs by giving them the
expected outcome of their program.
