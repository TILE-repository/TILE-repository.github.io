# Odd or even





Write a program that reads an integer number and tells whether it is
odd or even. Run the following examples to test that your program
gives the same outputs:

```small
>>> %Run 
    Enter an integer number: 1
    The number 1 is odd
>>> %Run 
    Enter an integer number: 0
    The number 0 is even
>>> %Run 
    Enter an integer number:111
    The number 1 is odd
>>> %Run 
    Enter an integer number: 23
    The number 23 is odd
>>> %Run 
    Enter an integer number: -34
    The number 0 is even
>>> %Run 
    Enter an integer number: -11
    The number -11 is odd
```

Insist that the students test their programs by giving them example
test executions.
