# Determine phase of life





Write a program that reads an age, and finds out if someone is in
their babyhood, childhood, adolescence, initial adulthood, mature
adulthood, or old age. Use the following approximate definitions:

-   Babyhood starts at birth and ends at 2 years of age.

-   Childhood ranges from 2 to 12 years of age The adolescence
    corresponds to the age ranging from 12 to 20 years.

-   Initial adulthood ranges from 20 to 40 years of age.

-   Mature adulthood begins at age 40 and ends at age 60.

-   Old age goes from 60 years on wards.

Run tests and ensure that each of the possible outputs has occurred
at least once.

```testruntile
Add minimal line saying the should test such that each possible
output has occurred.
```
