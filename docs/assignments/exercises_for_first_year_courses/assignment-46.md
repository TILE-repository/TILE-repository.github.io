# Limit exceeding sum





Write a program that finds the first value $$N$$ for which the sum
$$0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N$$ exceeds a LIMIT value that is entered by
keyboard. Run the following test cases to test your program:

    **test case ID**  | **input**  | **expected output**
    ---------| -------| -----------------
    1    |    0    |   1
    2    |     1    |   2
    3    |     25   |   7
    4    |     -5  |    0
    5    |    -450  |  0
    6     |    45   |   10

Insist that the students test their programs by giving them example
test cases in a table. We have explicitly added 0 and negative
numbers to make sure these are tested.
