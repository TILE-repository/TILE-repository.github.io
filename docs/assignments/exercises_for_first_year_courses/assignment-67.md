# Fibonacci sequences

Implement a function `fib(n)` that returns a list with the first `n` numbers of Fibonacci. If `n == 0`, the function must return the list `[1]`, if `n == 1`, the function must return the list `[1,1]`. When `n < 1`, then start with the list `[1,1]` and add the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous numbers in the list.

For example by typing:

```small
>>> print(fib(0))
    [1]
>>> print(fib(1))
    [1, 1]
>>> print(fib(2))
    [1, 1, 2]
>>> print(fib(12))
    [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233]
```

Don't forget your pytests to automate the tests!
