# Maximum value in a non-empty list

Write a function (`maxPos`) that, given a non-empty list, returns the position where its maximum value is found. Then complete the table below with the number of rows you see necessary to design your test set and run the automatic tests with pytest. This time it is not necessary to test the empty list, because the statement clearly says that your function only has to work for a non-empty list.\

    test case number |  input  | expected output
