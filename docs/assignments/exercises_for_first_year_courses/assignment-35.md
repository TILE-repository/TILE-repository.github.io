# Determine the quadrant of the Cartesian plane





Write a Python program to determine the quadrant of the Cartesian
plane given the (x, y) coordinates of a point.

To test this program try to execute a test case for each one of the
possible 9 outputs (i.e. the 4 different pieces of axis, the origin
and the 4 different quadrants).

```testruntile
Insist that the students test their programs by giving them hints on
what to test to get all possible outputs.
```
