# Remove odd numbers from a list of numbers

Write a function that, given a list of numbers, returns another list without the odd numbers. Then complete the table with the number of rows you see necessary to design your test set and run the automatic tests with pytest.

    | test case number | input | expected output |
    | ---------------- | ----- | --------------- |
    | 1                |       |
    | 2                |       |
    | 3                |       |
    | ....             |       |
