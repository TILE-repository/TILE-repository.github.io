# How to contribute

We welcome additions to this repository so we can all benefit from each others knowledge and material and improve software testing education one step at the time. Contributing can be done using the Fork and pull model. Anyone can fork this repository and push changes to their personal fork. You do not need permission to this repository to push to a user-owned fork. The changes can be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer.

## Forking this repository

Forking a repository is similar to copying a repository, with two major differences:

- You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your user-owned fork to the original repository, also known as the upstream repository.
- You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository.

More information in working with forks can be found in the Github Docs on [working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks).

Forking can be done on GitHub with the fork button. 
This is the repository that you need to fork if you want to contribute: [https://github.com/TILE-repository/TILE-repository.github.io](https://github.com/TILE-repository/TILE-repository.github.io).

Once the repository is forked to your personal repository, you can create new assignments on your personal repository just as you would do with any other GitHub repository.

## Add one or more assignments

To add assignments, copy the `template` folder in `/docs/assignments/` and rename it into something suitable for the assignment. Open the `index.md` the new folder and follow the instructions in this file.

## Check for build errors

This repository uses GitHub pages (Jekyll) to generate a static website. This is done automatically when changes are committed and pushed to your personal repository. If the build succeeds, a green checkmark appears on the GitHub repository page. If not, a red cross indicates that the build failed. By clicking on the red cross, details on the reasons for the failed build will be shown. Please fix any build errors before creating a pull request.

## Create a pull request

Commit and push the new file to your personal repository and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

The maintainers of the TILE repository will be notified and will review your submission. If the submission is accepted, a link will be placed on the [assignments](assignments/index.md) page.
