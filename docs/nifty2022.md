## Metadata

| Summary 		| Three Test Informed Learning by Example (TILE) based programming assignments. These assignments are usable examples of ways to apply the TILE approach to existing or new programming assignments with the objective to seamlessly, in a subtle way, introduce testing as early as possible in programming courses. |
| Topics 		| Testing, programming |
| Audience 		| These assignments are appropriate for a CS1 course. The method can also be used on CS2 assignments. |
| Difficulty 	| These are assignments for novice computer science students, but TILE can be used for more advanced assignments as well. |
| Strengths 	| TILE offers the potential of teaching testing "for free" and as early as possible without adding any additional strain on the course schedule. |
| Weaknesses 	| Whilst the teaching doesn't put strain on the course schedule itself, this approach does require effort to change existing course material in order to apply the method. We aim to reduce this effort by providing an open databank with more of these assignments. |
| Dependencies 	| This approach integrates into existing programming courses. The assignments presented here require knowledge of basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, datatypes, artithmetic operations and console input and output. |
| Variants 		| We identified three main type of TILES, however, this taxonomy can be extended into sub-types or other main types. |
