# TILE Podcast Episode 1: Introduction to TILE

**Welcome to the TILE Podcast!**

In this first episode, we dive into the concept of Test Informed Learning with Examples (TILE), a groundbreaking approach to integrating software testing into programming education from the very beginning. Here’s what we’ll cover in today’s episode:

**Introduction:**
- Welcome to the TILE podcast, hosted by Niels Doorn, a PhD student who advocates for improving computer science education through innovative teaching methods.
- Brief overview of the podcast’s purpose: to explore how TILE can transform the way we teach and learn programming.

**Main Content:**

**1. What is TILE?**
- **Definition**: TILE stands for Test Informed Learning with Examples. It’s an educational approach designed to introduce software testing early, seamlessly, and subtly within programming courses.
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Early**: Introduce students to testing from the first example program.
  - **Seamless**: Integrate testing as an inherent part of programming, not as a separate activity.
  - **Subtle**: Use clever and indirect methods to teach testing knowledge and skills.

**2. The Inspiration Behind TILE:**
- **Origins**: Inspired by Test-driven learning (TDL), coined by Janzen and Saiedian in 2006, which used testing to explore programming concepts.
- **Evolution**: While TDL evolved towards Test Driven Development (TDD), TILE fills the gap by providing a defined approach to introduce testing effortlessly in programming courses.

**3. Why TILE Matters:**
- **Educational Impact**: Helps students develop a deep understanding of the importance of testing, ensuring they write robust and error-free code.
- **Practical Benefits**: By making testing a natural part of the learning process, students are better prepared for real-world programming challenges.

**Practical Tips for Educators:**
- **Start Small**: Begin with simple testing examples and gradually introduce more complex testing scenarios.
- **Integrate Testing**: Make testing an inherent part of programming exercises from day one.
- **Be Subtle**: Use indirect methods to teach testing, such as embedding testing tasks within programming assignments.

**Conclusion:**
- **Summary**: We’ve introduced the concept of TILE, its principles, and why it’s crucial for modern programming education.
- **Call to Action**: Think about how you can start integrating TILE in your teaching. Try incorporating a simple testing task in your next programming assignment.
- **Teaser for Next Episode**: Join us in the next episode where we’ll delve deeper into the background and inspiration for TILE, including more about TDL and how TILE has evolved.
